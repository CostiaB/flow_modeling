# Flow modeling in a flat channel with electrodes
![Modeling example](info/Studio_Project(1).gif?raw=true)

In this project, you can find scripts for calculating the Navier-Stokes equation and the Convective diffusion equation to understand speed, pressure, and concentration distribution. You can change parameters such as electrode width and height, distance between electrodes, etc.
